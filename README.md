-length   Set the length of path (deafult 10).
-src      Set the source of the path (default 1).
-v        Print each step of the algorithm execution.
-p        Print the list of node joinable in -length steps.
-allDiff  Set the allDifferent constraint.
-c        Count the number of paths from the source
-pFath    Print the fathers list, if in verbose mode.
-f        Set the file path to read the input to parse.
-loop     The algorithm computes paths from 1 to -length
